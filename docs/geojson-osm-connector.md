# GeoJSON-Connector: Semantic Search for Geospatial (OSM) Features

This guide outlines the process of creating a semantic search system for OpenStreetMap (OSM) features. The goal is to enable users to search for geospatial data using natural language queries, retrieving both specific features (e.g., "Eiffel Tower") and collections of features (e.g., "hospitals in Paris").

## Overview

The process involves the following main steps:

1. Fetching and processing OSM data
2. Creating meaningful textual representations of features
3. Generating two types of documents:
   a. Individual feature documents
   b. Feature collection documents
4. Loading documents into a vector store
5. Implementing the semantic search

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Fetching and Processing OSM Data

The class provided assumes you have already fetched OSM data. This data typically comes in a GeoJSON format, containing features with geometries and properties.

### 2. Creating Meaningful Textual Representations

The class includes methods to enrich the OSM data:

- `_get_osm_tag_description_async`: Fetches descriptions for OSM tags from the OpenStreetMap wiki.
- `add_descriptions_to_features`: Adds these descriptions to the feature properties.
- `_get_feature_description`: Generates a textual description of a feature, including its address and other properties.

### 3. Generating Documents

Two types of documents are generated:

a. Individual Feature Documents:
   - Created for features with names (e.g., specific landmarks).
   - Includes the feature name, description, and all properties.
   - Useful for queries about specific places.

b. Feature Collection Documents:
   - Groups features by their OSM tag (e.g., all hospitals).
   - Includes a description of the tag and a count of features.
   - Useful for queries about types of places.

The `_features_to_docs` method handles the creation of both document types.

### 4. Loading Documents into a Vector Store

While not shown in the provided code, the next step would be to load these documents into a vector store. This typically involves:

1. Generating embeddings for each document.
2. Storing these embeddings along with the document metadata in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS).

### 5. Implementing the Semantic Search

To implement the search:

1. Convert the user's query into an embedding using the same model used for the documents.
2. Perform a similarity search in the vector store to find the most relevant documents.
3. Retrieve the corresponding geospatial data (either individual features or feature collections).
4. Return the results to the user, possibly with additional context from the document content.

## Code Highlights

Here are some key methods from the provided class:

```python
async def add_descriptions_to_features(self) -> None:
    # Fetches and adds descriptions to features
    ...

def _group_features_by_tag(self) -> Dict[str, List[dict]]:
    # Groups features by their OSM tag
    ...

def _convert_to_geojson(self, data):
    # Converts features to GeoJSON format
    ...

async def _features_to_docs(self) -> List[Document]:
    # Creates documents for individual features and feature collections
    ...
```

## Considerations

- Performance: The class uses asynchronous methods and semaphores to efficiently fetch tag descriptions.
- Scalability: Consider chunking large datasets and processing them in batches.
- Updates: Implement a system to regularly update your vector store as OSM data changes.
- Query Processing: Develop a robust query understanding system to interpret user intentions (e.g., distinguishing between queries for specific places vs. types of places).

By following these steps and utilizing the provided class, you can create a powerful semantic search system for geospatial data, enabling intuitive and flexible querying of OSM features.
